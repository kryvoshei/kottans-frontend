**Things new to me:**
I have used before a few commands, such as ***git add***, ***git commit***, ***git push***, ***git clone***, ***git status***, ***git merge*** so many things were actually new. They definitely should be put into practice as much as possible to solidify knowledge.

**What surprised me:**
The anatomy of a commit message was a complete discovery. So, I know now that a commit message is generally broken up into a few sections. The first line is usually kept to about 50 characters or less. The line contains a short description of what the commit changes are about. After the first line, comes an empty line, and the rest of the text is usually kept under 72 characters.

**Things to be used in the future:**
- git rm - deletes or removes a file;
- git reset - basically resets the repo, throwing away some changes;
- git commit --amend - is used to make changes to commits after-the-fact, which can be useful for making notes about a given commit;
- git revert - makes a new commit which effectively rolls back a previous commit.

**Things new to me:**
Introduction to git commits was quite simple. But it never hurts to repeat the information.

**What surprised me:**
Practicing how to fetch data from a remote repository with the command ***git fetch*** was valuable.

**Things to be used in the future:**
All the commands from this part of https://learngitbranching.js.org/ (namely, git push, git pull, git fetch, etc.) can be used in the workflow.
