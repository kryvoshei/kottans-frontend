**Things new to me:**
<p>I have used before a few commands, such as *git add*, *git commit*, *git push*, *git clone*, *git status*, *git merge* so many things were actually new. They definitely should be put into practice as much as possible to solidify knowledge.</p>

**What struck me:**
<p>The anatomy of a commit message was a complete discovery. So, I know now that a commit message is generally broken up into a few sections. The first line is usually kept to about 50 characters or less. The line contains a short description of what the commit changes are about. After the first line, comes an empty line, and the rest of the text is usually kept under 72 characters.</p>

**Things to be used in the future:**

- <code>git rm</code> - deletes or removes a file;
- <code>git reset</code> - basically resets the repo, throwing away some changes;
- <code>git commit</code> --amend - is used to make changes to commits after-the-fact, which can be useful for making notes about a given commit;
- <code>git revert</code> - makes a new commit which effectively rolls back a previous commit.

**Things new to me:**
<p>Introduction to git commits was quite simple. But it never hurts to repeat the information.</p>

**What struck me:**
<p>Practicing how to fetch data from a remote repository with the command <code>git fetch</code> was valuable.</p>

**Things to be used in the future:**
<p>All the commands from this part of https://learngitbranching.js.org/ (namely, <code>git push</code>, <code>git pull</code>, <code>git fetch</code>, etc.) can be used in the workflow.</p>

**Things new to me:**
<p>This is my first time working with Linux, or better said - with a simulated Linux terminal. When you face something for the first time, everything is an unexplored territory.</p>

**What struck me:**
<p>
<ul>
<li><code>ps aux</code> - to list all the processes;</li>
<li><code>chmod</code> - to change mode, change security permissions (for u - user, g - group, o - other);</li>
<li><code>man</code> (stands for manual) - displays portions of online documentation;</li>
<li><code>man man</code> - allows to search for commands which partain to a particular subject.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

**Things to be used in the future:**
<p>I am pretty sure that I will use Linux in practice someday and the studied material will come to the rescue. If all the commands exist, then they are used, hopefully, I will use all of them.</p>

  <h3>HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know—Part 1</h3>
  
**Things new to me:**
<p>HTTP verbs in a request that are though less used: <strong>HEAD</strong>, <strong>TRACE</strong>, <strong>OPTIONS</strong>.</p>

**What struck me:**
<p>Number of general headers are shared by both the request and response messages: <code>Cache-Control</code>, <code>Connection</code>, <code>Connection</code>, <code>Pragma</code>, <code>Trailer</code>, <code>Transfer-encoding</code>, <code>Via</code>, <code>Upgrade</code>.
</p>

**Things to be used in the future:**
<p>How to send an HTTP Request With the Fetch API and choose the right HTTP verbs and headers for my use-case.</p>
